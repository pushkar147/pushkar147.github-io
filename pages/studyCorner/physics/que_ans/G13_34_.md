	<br>
		The charge density is \(\rho = Q\{\delta(x-x_0)-\delta(x+x_0)\}\), which means, there are two point charges. One is at \(x-x_0=0 \ i.e. \ x=x_0\) with charge +Q and another at \(x+x_0=0 \ i.e. \ x=-x_0\) with charge -Q.We have to find electric field at \(x=2x_0\).

	<br>
	&emsp; The electric field at \(x=2x_0\) is the vector addition of electric fields due to these individual charges. For both these charges, the electric field is along x-axis.
