### Question-

<div>
	The Lagrangian of a system with one degree of freedom \(q\) is given by \(L=\alpha \dot q^2 + \beta q^2 \), where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are non-zero constants. If \(p_q\) denotes the canonical momentum conjugate to \(q\) then which one of the following statements os CORRECT?
	<br><br>
	a) \(p_q = 2 \beta q \) and it is a conserved quantity.
	<br>
	b) \(p_q = 2 \beta q \) and it is not a conserved quantity.
	<br>
	c) \(p_q = 2 \alpha \dot q \) and it is a conserved quantity.
	<br>
	d) \(p_q = 2 \alpha \dot q \) and it is not a conserved quantity.

	<summary> Step-by-Step Solution </summary>
	<br>
	By defination, \[p_q = {d L \over d \dot q} = 2 \alpha \dot q \]
	\(p_q\) will be conserved if \[{d p_q \over d t} = 0 \]
	i.e. \[{d  \over d t} \left ({d L \over d \dot q} \right) = 0 \tag 1 \]
	<br>
	Lagrange's equation gives, \[{d  \over d t} \left ({d L \over d \dot q} \right) - {d L \over d q} = 0 \tag 2 \]
	<br>
	From (1) and (2), we conclude that \(p_q\) will be conserved if \[{d L \over d q} = 0 \]
	In our case, \[{d L \over d q} = 2 \beta q \ne 0 \]
	Hence \(p_q\) is not a conserved quantity for given system.
