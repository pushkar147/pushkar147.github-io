		<u>Case 1:</u>
			<br>&emsp;
			All 4 balls in 1 box and remaining 4 boxes are empty.
			Since boxes are 5 and they are <b>distinguishable</b>, there are 5 ways in this case.
			<br>
			
		<u>Case 2:</u>
			<br>&emsp;
			All 4 balls in 2 boxes and remaining 3 boxes are empty.
			First we have to choose 2 boxes from 5, which can be done in \(^5 C_2 = 10 \) ways.
			Then we have to choose distribution of 4 balls in selected 2 boxes. This can be done in 3 ways viz., {(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Order is important, since boxes are distinguishable.
			<br>&emsp;
			Thus, there are total \(10 \times 3 = 30 \) ways in this case.
			<br>
			
		<u>Case 3:</u>
			<br>&emsp;
			All 4 balls in 3 boxes and remaining 2 boxes are empty.
			First we have to choose 3 boxes from 5, which can be done in \(^5 C_3 = 10 \) ways.
			Then we have to choose distribution of 4 balls in selected 3 boxes. This can be done in 3 ways viz., {(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(2,1,1)}. Order is important, since boxes are distinguishable.
			<br>&emsp;
			Thus, there are total \(10 \times 3 = 30 \) ways in this case.
			<br>
			
		<u>Case 4:</u>
			<br>&emsp;
			The last case is 4 balls in 4 boxes and 1 box is empty.
			We have to choose 4 boxes from 5, which can be done in \(^5 C_4 = 5 \) ways.
			There is unique distribution of 4 balls in selected 4 boxes viz., {(1,1,1,1)}.
			<br>&emsp;
			Thus, there are total \(5 \times 1 = 5 \) ways in this case.
			<br>
			
			
			<br>&emsp;
			Considering all the cases, number of distinct ways are \[ 5+30+30+5 =70 \]
